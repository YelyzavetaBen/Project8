<h2>Overview</h2>
In the competitive telecom industry, understanding customer needs and service performance is crucial. A leading telecom company required an insightful dashboard to visualize call centre customer behavior and retention patterns. The goal was to present this data in a self-explanatory manner suitable for review and decision-making.

<h2>Goal</h2>
The primary goal was to design a Power BI dashboard that provides clear, visual insights into customer retention, helping the retention department identify at-risk customers before they terminate their contracts. This proactive approach aims to reduce customer churn by enabling timely interventions.


<h2>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Metrics:</h2>

- Churn Analysis: Identification of factors contributing to customer churn.
- Customer Profile: Detailed breakdown of customer demographics and service usage.
- Risk Indicators: Highlighted at-risk customers for proactive retention efforts.
- Service Impact: Analyzed the impact of different services on customer retention.

<h2>Approach</h2>
I utilized Power BI to design a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard. The dashboard employed various visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to ensure the data was easily interpretable. This approach highlighted critical aspects of call centre performance, making important trends and insights clear.


<h2>Results</h2>
The dashboard enabled PhoneNow's retention department to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and retention, facilitating proactive measures to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction. This project demonstrated the power of data visualization and predictive analytics in addressing complex business challenges.
